Project 1 for Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

To use this website, please register and sign in with a username and password. All passwords are encrypted and stored as a salted hash in the database. Then, you can search for a book using any combination of title, author, and ISBN. Once at the book details page, which includes data pulled from the Goodreads API, you can leave a review and rating of the book and view any reviews of books left by other users. (Search for "Foundation" by Isaac Asimov to see an example.) 

In addition, this app includes an API providing the author, year, title, ISBN, number of reviews, and average rating of any book found on the site. To use it, navigate to /api/&lt;isbn&gt;. The ISBN number of Foundation is 0553803719.
